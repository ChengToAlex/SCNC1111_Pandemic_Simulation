# SCNC1111_Pandemic_Simulation
SCNC1111 is a year 1 course offered by the Faculty of Science HKU, and this is a program I wrote in C# .NET Framework 4.8

1. The program will create a list of people in a population with 3 characteristics assigned to each person, ID, whether this person is infected and apprehended by the government.
2. In each cycle, an infected person will contact a random number of healthy individuals (the maximum number can be set)
3. In each cycle, an infected person will have a chance to be cured or arrested (quarantined)
4. Contagious populations are those who are infected but not arrested (quarantined)

The Number of Infected population and Contagious population will be monitored and the result will be exported into an Excel file in the Output folder.
